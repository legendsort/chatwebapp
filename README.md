# React Slack Clone

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1457604/35891289-687ad6ec-0b9b-11e8-99cc-ffbad31a017e.gif)

This is a static, single page web app bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for ease of setup, distribution and development. It is a thin UI wrapper around the [pusher-chatkit-client](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-client-js) library to demonstrate how different features can work together to form a compelling real-time chat client with various potential product applications.

You can view a deploy of this application at https://pusher.github.io/react-slack-clone

## Usage

To get started you will need to clone the repo, install dependencies and run the app.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pusher/react-slack-clone
$ cd react-slack-clone
$ yarn && yarn start
```

The app will start in development mode and open a browser window on `http://localhost:3000`. The project will rebuild and the browser will reload automatically when source files are changed. Any build or runtime errors are also propagated to and displayed in the browser.

The app depends on a GitHub authentication and user creation endpoint that is hosted [here](https://chatkit-demo-server.herokuapp.com).

## Features

The Chatkit SDK allows you to implement features you would expect from a chat client. these include:

- üìù Public and private chat rooms
- üì° Realtime sending and receiving of messages
- üì¶ Rich media attachments (drag and drop)
- üí¨ Typing and presence indicators
- üìö Read message cursors
